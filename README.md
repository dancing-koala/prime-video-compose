# Prime Video Compose

Prime Video Compose is a very simple Prime Video clone app made with Jetpack Compose.

## What it is

* An empty shell, only UI is implemented
* An educational project on Jetpack Compose
* Over-engineered (some composables are voluntarily complex)

## What it is NOT

* An official Amazon product
* A Prime Video third-party app
* A pixel perfect clone
